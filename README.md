# Mehedi Hasan Shakil

Machine Learning Engineer | Deep Learning | NLP | Security

I work on applied machine learning problems with a focus on security, natural language processing, and real-world deployment. My experience includes deep learning–based malware detection, intrusion detection systems, NLP models using transformers, and end-to-end ML pipelines from data preprocessing to API deployment. I have published peer-reviewed research at IEEE conferences and enjoy building systems that balance research rigor with practical usability.
